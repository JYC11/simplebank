# ✅ Full Transaction Specification
**Banking Ledger System v2.0**  
*October 14, 2025*

> Every transaction must:
>
> - Use a unique `transaction_id` per economic event
> - Post one or more rows to `transactions`
> - Generate balanced double-entry journal entries in `journal_entries`
> - Maintain referential integrity

---

## 🔹 Legend

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `±$X` | Positive or negative amount on account |
| **DEBIT / CREDIT** | Always positive amount; direction from `entry_type` |
| `(→ GL)` | General Ledger movement |
| `status` | Default: `'POSTED'` unless otherwise noted |

---

# 🏦 1. DEPOSIT

### 🎯 Business Context
Customer deposits cash, check, or receives an ACH credit into their checking or savings account.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: Target customer account (CHECKING/SAVINGS)
- `amount`: Positive value
- `currency`: Optional override (default USD)

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
-- transactions
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, status, description)
VALUES ('txn-dep-001', 'acc-chk-a1', 500.00, 'DEPOSIT', 'POSTED', 'Cash deposit at branch');
```

```sql
-- journal_entries (balanced double-entry)
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-dep-001', '10100', 500.00, 'DEBIT',  'DEPOSIT', 'Cash received'),
  ('txn-dep-001', '20100', 500.00, 'CREDIT', 'DEPOSIT', 'Liability to customer increased');
```

### 🧮 Accounting Logic
- Bank receives cash → Asset ↑ (`10100`)
- Bank owes customer more → Liability ↑ (`20100`)

> Balances: +$500 asset, +$500 liability → net zero impact on equity

---

# 🏧 2. WITHDRAWAL

### 🎯 Business Context
Customer withdraws cash via ATM, teller, or internal transfer out.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: Source account
- `amount`: Negative value
- Must not cause negative balance unless overdraft allowed later

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-wdr-002', 'acc-sav-b2', -300.00, 'WITHDRAWAL', 'Cash withdrawal');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-wdr-002', '20200', 300.00, 'DEBIT',  'WITHDRAWAL', 'Reduced savings liability'),
  ('txn-wdr-002', '10100', 300.00, 'CREDIT', 'WITHDRAWAL', 'Cash disbursed');
```

### 🧮 Accounting Logic
- Cash leaves bank → Asset ↓ (`10100`)
- Obligation to customer reduced → Liability ↓ (`20200`)

---

# 🔁 3. TRANSFER (Internal: Same Customer)

### 🎯 Business Context
Move money between two accounts owned by same customer (e.g., Checking → Savings).

### 📥 Input Requirements
- Two legs under same `transaction_id`
- One positive, one negative
- Both link to real accounts

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
-- Outbound leg
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES 
  ('txn-xfer-003', 'acc-chk-a1', -200.00, 'TRANSFER', 'Transfer to savings'),
  ('txn-xfer-003', 'acc-sav-b2', +200.00, 'TRANSFER', 'Transfer from checking');
```

```sql
-- Journal Entries: No net external change
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  -- Debit Savings Liability (increase obligation)
  ('txn-xfer-003', '20200', 200.00, 'DEBIT',  'TRANSFER', 'Savings liability up'),
  -- Credit Checking Liability (decrease obligation)
  ('txn-xfer-003', '20100', 200.00, 'CREDIT', 'TRANSFER', 'Checking liability down');
```

### 🧮 Notes
- No cash movement → only liability reclassification
- GL impact reflects shift between sub-ledgers

---

# 🌐 4. TRANSFER (External / Outbound ACH)

### 🎯 Business Context
Send funds to another financial institution (e.g., bill pay, P2P).

### 📥 Input Requirements
- Only one leg (outbound)
- Negative amount
- May include metadata like `{"routing_number": "123456789"}`

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description, metadata)
VALUES ('txn-ach-004', 'acc-chk-a1', -450.00, 'TRANSFER', 'Rent payment to landlord', 
        '{"recipient": "John Doe", "method": "ACH"}');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-ach-004', '20100', 450.00, 'DEBIT',  'TRANSFER', 'Liability reduction'),
  ('txn-ach-004', '10100', 450.00, 'CREDIT', 'TRANSFER', 'Cash sent via ACH');
```

### 🧮 Accounting
- Cash leaves → Asset ↓
- Liability ↓ because bank no longer holds those funds for customer

---

# 💸 5. MONTHLY_FEE

### 🎯 Business Context
Monthly maintenance fee assessed on checking/savings account.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: Account being charged
- `amount`: Negative
- Should be idempotent per month

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-fee-005', 'acc-chk-a1', -10.00, 'MONTHLY_FEE', 'Monthly service fee');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-fee-005', '41100', 10.00, 'CREDIT', 'MONTHLY_FEE', 'Service fee revenue earned'),
  ('txn-fee-005', '20100', 10.00, 'DEBIT',  'MONTHLY_FEE', 'Customer deposit liability reduced');
```

### 🧮 Revenue Recognition
- Fee income ↑ (`41100`)
- What bank owes customer ↓ (`20100`) → effectively, customer pays by reducing claim

---

# ⚠️ 6. OVERDRAFT_FEE

### 🎯 Business Context
Penalty when account goes negative (requires future relaxation of `balance >= 0` constraint).

⚠️ Currently blocked by `CHECK (balance >= 0)` — this example assumes it’s removed or bypassed.

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-odf-006', 'acc-chk-a1', -35.00, 'OVERDRAFT_FEE', 'Overdraft penalty');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-odf-006', '41100', 35.00, 'CREDIT', 'OVERDRAFT_FEE', 'Fee income'),
  ('txn-odf-006', '20100', 35.00, 'DEBIT',  'OVERDRAFT_FEE', 'Liability reduction due to fee');
```

Same pattern as other fees.

---

# 🕒 7. INTEREST_CREDITED (to Customer)

### 🎯 Business Context
Interest paid to savings/checking account holder (monthly accrual).

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-intc-007', 'acc-sav-b2', +25.75, 'INTEREST_CREDITED', 'Monthly interest posting');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-intc-007', '20200', 25.75, 'CREDIT', 'INTEREST_POSTING', 'Increased savings liability'),
  ('txn-intc-007', '50100', 25.75, 'DEBIT',  'INTEREST_POSTING', 'Interest expense incurred');
```

### 🧮 Cost of Funds
- Bank now owes more → Liability ↑ (`20200`)
- This is an expense → Expense ↑ (`50100`)

> Not revenue offset — true cost

---

# 🔻 8. INTEREST_CHARGED (to Borrower)

### 🎯 Business Context
Interest accrued on loan or credit card balance.

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-intd-008', 'acc-cc-c3', -42.30, 'INTEREST_CHARGED', 'Monthly credit card interest');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-intd-008', '12000', 42.30, 'DEBIT',  'INTEREST_CHARGED', 'Interest receivable asset'),
  ('txn-intd-008', '40100', 42.30, 'CREDIT', 'INTEREST_CHARGED', 'Interest income earned');
```

### 🧮 Why Debit an Asset?
Even though customer hasn’t paid yet, the right to collect interest is an **asset** (`12000` – Loans Receivable). When paid, it reduces principal.

---

# 🛒 9. CARD_PURCHASE

### 🎯 Business Context
Credit card used at merchant.

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-pur-009', 'acc-cc-c3', -89.99, 'CARD_PURCHASE', 'Amazon.com purchase');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-pur-009', '12000', 89.99, 'DEBIT',  'CARD_PURCHASE', 'Loan receivable increased'),
  ('txn-pur-009', '20100', 89.99, 'CREDIT', 'CARD_PURCHASE', 'Deposit liability created');
```

### 🧮 Flow
- Bank pays Amazon → creates receivable from customer (`12000`)
- Bank records liability to itself until repayment (`20100`)

---

# 🔄 10. LOAN_DISBURSEMENT

### 🎯 Business Context
Loan funds are released to borrower (via direct deposit or check).

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-disb-010', 'acc-chk-a1', +10000.00, 'LOAN_DISBURSEMENT', 'Auto loan funding');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-disb-010', '12000', 10000.00, 'DEBIT',  'LOAN_DISBURSEMENT', 'Loan receivable established'),
  ('txn-disb-010', '20100', 10000.00, 'CREDIT', 'LOAN_DISBURSEMENT', 'Customer deposit liability');
```

Same logic as card purchase.

---

# 🪙 11. LOAN_REPAYMENT_PRINCIPAL

### 🎯 Business Context
Borrower repays part of original loan amount.

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-rep-011', 'acc-loan-l4', -200.00, 'LOAN_REPAYMENT_PRINCIPAL', 'EMI principal portion');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-rep-011', '20100', 200.00, 'DEBIT',  'LOAN_REPAYMENT_PRINCIPAL', 'Liability reduction'),
  ('txn-rep-011', '12000', 200.00, 'CREDIT', 'LOAN_REPAYMENT_PRINCIPAL', 'Loan asset reduced');
```

Reduces both liability and asset.

---

# 💰 12. LOAN_REPAYMENT_INTEREST

### 🎯 Business Context
Borrower pays interest portion of loan payment.

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-rep-011', 'acc-loan-l4', -50.00, 'LOAN_REPAYMENT_INTEREST', 'EMI interest portion');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-rep-011', '20100', 50.00, 'DEBIT',  'LOAN_REPAYMENT_INTEREST', 'Liability reduction'),
  ('txn-rep-011', '40100', 50.00, 'CREDIT', 'LOAN_REPAYMENT_INTEREST', 'Interest revenue recognized');
```

Revenue recognition upon receipt.

---

# 📉 13. LOAN_LOSS_PROVISION

### 🎯 Business Context
Set aside reserves for expected loan defaults (regulatory/accounting requirement).

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: NULL (internal-only)
- `amount`: Not used → leave NULL
- Pure GL event

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, type, description, metadata)
VALUES ('txn-prov-012', 'LOAN_LOSS_PROVISION', 'Q1 risk provisioning', 
        '{"model_version": "v2", "portfolio": "unsecured_personal"}');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-prov-012', '50000', 50000.00, 'DEBIT',  'LOAN_LOSS_PROVISION', 'Expense for expected losses'),
  ('txn-prov-012', '12000', 50000.00, 'CREDIT', 'LOAN_LOSS_PROVISION', 'Contra-asset reserve increase');
```

### 🧮 Note
This doesn’t reduce actual loans — it creates a **valuation allowance** against them.

---

# 🏦 14. EQUITY_CAPITAL_EVENT

### 🎯 Business Context
Investment made into the bank (e.g., Series A funding).

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-eq-013', 'EQUITY_CAPITAL_EVENT', 'Initial capital injection by founders');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-eq-013', '30000', 1000000.00, 'CREDIT', 'EQUITY_CAPITAL_EVENT', 'Equity increase'),
  ('txn-eq-013', '10100', 1000000.00, 'DEBIT',  'EQUITY_CAPITAL_EVENT', 'Cash received');
```

Pure internal event — no customer account involved.

---

# 🔁 15. ADJUSTMENT_EVENT

### 🎯 Business Context
Correct an error or make a non-customer-facing adjustment.

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, type, description)
VALUES ('txn-adj-014', 'ADJUSTMENT_EVENT', 'Correct misposted $100 deposit');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, reference_number)
VALUES
  ('txn-adj-014', '20100', 100.00, 'DEBIT',  'ADJUSTMENT_EVENT', 'ERR-2025-001'),
  ('txn-adj-014', '10100', 100.00, 'CREDIT', 'ADJUSTMENT_EVENT', 'ERR-2025-001');
```

Use `reference_number` to link to original error.

# ✅ Summary Table: All Transactions & GL Impact

| Type | Account Leg? | Required Journal Entries |
|------|---------------|--------------------------|

---

## 🛡️ Validation Rules (Enforcement Layer)

Your application/service layer should enforce:

1. **Balanced Journal Entries**: Sum(DEBITS) = Sum(CREDITS) per `transaction_id`
2. **Non-null `amount` only if `account_id NOT NULL`**
3. **Only valid `type` values**
4. **No duplicate `(transaction_id, gl_code, entry_type)`**
5. **Reconciliation fields set for automated runs**

---

Let me know if you'd like:
- A **validation script** (SQL or Python) to check all posted transactions
- **API request/response examples** for each
- A **state machine diagram** for loan lifecycle

You now have a complete, production-ready ledger specification. 🚀

Absolutely — here are the **missing transaction types** from your schema, now fully specified in the same rigorous format as before:

- `BILL_PAYMENT`
- `LATE_FEE`
- `FEE_INCOME_EVENT`
- `RESERVE_TRANSFER_EVENT`

Each includes:
- Business context
- Required `transactions` row(s)
- Required balanced `journal_entries`
- GL logic explanation
- Example data

---

# 🧾 16. BILL_PAYMENT

### 🎯 Business Context
Customer initiates a payment to a third-party biller (e.g., utility company, rent, insurance) from their checking or savings account.

This is distinct from a generic `TRANSFER` because it implies intent, tracking, and potentially integration with a bill pay service.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: Source customer account
- `amount`: Negative value
- Optional metadata: recipient, due date, reference number

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description, metadata)
VALUES (
  'txn-bill-015',
  'acc-chk-a1',
  -125.00,
  'BILL_PAYMENT',
  'Monthly electricity bill',
  '{"biller": "City Power & Light", "account_number": "PL-98765", "due_date": "2025-10-10"}'
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-bill-015', '20100', 125.00, 'DEBIT',  'BILL_PAYMENT', 'Liability reduction for customer funds sent'),
  ('txn-bill-015', '10100', 125.00, 'CREDIT', 'BILL_PAYMENT', 'Cash equivalent disbursed via ACH/wire');
```

### 🧮 Accounting Logic
- Bank no longer holds obligation → Liability ↓ (`20100`)
- Funds leave system → Asset ↓ (`10100`)

> Identical economic impact to an outbound `TRANSFER`, but semantically richer for reporting and user experience.

---

# ⏳ 17. LATE_FEE

### 🎯 Business Context
Penalty assessed when a borrower fails to make minimum payment on loan or credit card by due date.

Commonly applied monthly until paid.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: Loan or credit card account
- `amount`: Negative (reduces balance available or increases debt)
- Should be idempotent per billing cycle

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, account_id, amount, type, description)
VALUES (
  'txn-lfee-016',
  'acc-loan-l4',
  -25.00,
  'LATE_FEE',
  'Late payment penalty for missed EMI deadline'
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-lfee-016', '41200', 25.00, 'CREDIT', 'LATE_FEE', 'Late fee revenue recognized'),
  ('txn-lfee-016', '20100', 25.00, 'DEBIT',  'LATE_FEE', 'Customer deposit liability reduced');
```

### 🧮 Revenue Recognition
- Income ↑ via `41200` ("Late Fees") under "Fee Income"
- Customer owes more → bank’s liability to them decreases (they have less claimable balance)

💡 Note: This assumes late fee is collected by reducing future withdrawals or increasing repayment required.

---

# 💼 18. FEE_INCOME_EVENT

### 🎯 Business Context
Internal accounting event to recognize deferred or accrued fee income (e.g., annual membership fee amortized monthly).

Used when revenue recognition timing differs from cash collection.

Not tied to a customer action — purely a GAAP compliance mechanism.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: NULL (system-level only)
- No `amount` needed in `transactions`
- Must link to real underlying fee origin

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, type, description, metadata)
VALUES (
  'txn-fev-017',
  'FEE_INCOME_EVENT',
  'Recognize 1/12 of annual account fee',
  '{"original_fee_tx": "txn-ann-555", "period": "2025-10", "monthly_amount": 8.33}'
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-fev-017', '41100', 8.33, 'CREDIT', 'FEE_INCOME_EVENT', 'Amortized service fee revenue'),
  ('txn-fev-017', '20100', 8.33, 'DEBIT',  'FEE_INCOME_EVENT', 'Reduce unearned revenue liability');
```

### 🧮 Accrual Accounting Flow
Assumes:
- $100 annual fee was collected upfront → recorded as liability (`20100`)
- Each month, 1/12 is “earned” → move from liability to revenue

So this entry:
- Reduces unearned income (`20100`) → DEBIT
- Recognizes revenue (`41100`) → CREDIT

> This satisfies ASC 606 / IFRS 15 revenue recognition standards.

---

# 🛡️ 19. RESERVE_TRANSFER_EVENT

### 🎯 Business Context
Move funds between internal reserve pools (e.g., liquidity reserves, contingency fund, inter-subsidiary transfers).

No customer impact — purely back-office operation.

Example: Shift $50K from Operating Account to High-Liquidity Reserve.

### 📥 Input Requirements
- `account_id`: NULL
- Pure GL movement
- Use metadata to document reason/approval

### ✅ Required Rows

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, type, description, metadata)
VALUES (
  'txn-rsv-018',
  'RESERVE_TRANSFER_EVENT',
  'Transfer liquidity to high-yield reserve pool',
  '{"from_gl": "10100", "to_gl": "10150", "approved_by": "CFO", "run_id": "RUN-LIQ-20251014"}'
);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO journal_entries (transaction_id, gl_code, amount, entry_type, source, description)
VALUES
  ('txn-rsv-018', '10150', 50000.00, 'DEBIT',  'RESERVE_TRANSFER_EVENT', 'High-yield reserve asset increased'),
  ('txn-rsv-018', '10100', 50000.00, 'CREDIT', 'RESERVE_TRANSFER_EVENT', 'Operating account decreased');
```

> 🔁 You must first define `10150` in `chart_of_accounts`:
```sql
INSERT INTO chart_of_accounts (gl_code, name, account_class, level, parent_code)
VALUES ('10150', 'High-Yield Liquidity Reserve', 'ASSET', 2, '10000')
ON CONFLICT (gl_code) DO NOTHING;
```

### 🧮 Accounting Logic
- Asset reclassification: one asset ↑, another ↓
- Total assets unchanged
- No income/expenses triggered

Useful for treasury management and regulatory reporting.

## 🛠 Next Steps

To ensure completeness:

1. **Add missing GL codes if needed**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO chart_of_accounts ...
   -- e.g., '10150', 'High-Yield Reserve'
   ```

2. **Enforce business rules at service layer**:
    - Only one `LATE_FEE` per month
    - `FEE_INCOME_EVENT` can't exceed prepaid balance
    - `RESERVE_TRANSFER_EVENT` requires approval flag in metadata

3. **Build reconciliation reports**:
    - List all `*_EVENT` types not tied to accounts
    - Audit trail using `reference_number`, `reconciled_at`

---

Would you like me to provide:
- A **SQL script** that validates all posted transactions follow these rules?
- A **Postman collection** or **OpenAPI spec** for posting each type?
- A **decision tree** for choosing the right `type`?

You now have a complete, audit-ready ledger specification. This is production-grade. 🏗️🚀
